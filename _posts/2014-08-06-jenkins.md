All 25 slave nodes are running Ubuntu Linux. The nodes in [] are offline.


Setting  Up a Node
-------------------

First install Ubuntu and file a ServiceNow bug asking for a static IP address.

* Install the Android SDK
* Install OpenSSH for SSH access
* Install Git
* Install an MTA so cron-logs can be mailed
* Edit the  /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules file to add the rules for devices that will be connected to the node
* Make sure that the devices that will be connected to the node have been added and merged to the https://github.com/mozilla/webqa-credentials repository
* Clone  https://github.com/mozilla/webqa-credentials to the home folder of the default user and setup a cronjob to  update the repo every 15 mins
* Create the /var/jenkins/ folder and make sure it has the right permissions
* Double check that everything is installed and working before bring up the node in Jenkins.
